I'm software developer from ≈Åapy, Poland. I'm mainly work with python and js. I like solid software that is working as expected under different circumstances and has clean design.
Currently, I am working on software that use statistical methods for automation - it is called [MLJAR](https://github.com/mljar/mljar). I believe that our civilization deserve a solution which brings more than just insights from data. My goal is to build a software that can take actions based on data (interact with data, not just use it as input).
